# Obsidian_annotator

**Obsidian_annotator** is a lightweight, no-frills tool for English learners—especially Japanese speakers—who want to deeply understand English texts with the help of GPT-powered **inline footnote annotations**.

It reads `.txt` files, splits them into ~600-word chunks, auto-detects the **genre**, applies genre-specific annotation guidance, and sends each chunk to GPT-4o to generate easy-to-understand annotations in **Obsidian-style footnotes**.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- Automatically detects the text's **genre** (e.g., literary fiction, fantasy, self-help)
- Applies **genre-specific annotation strategy**
- Adds annotations for:
  - 📚 Difficult or abstract vocabulary
  - 🔧 Complex grammar and syntax
  - 💓 Emotional nuance and tone
  - 🧠 Idioms or ambiguous expressions
  - 🗝️ Symbolism and metaphor
  - 🌍 Cultural references
  - 🧩 Subtle interpretation or logic
  - ⏳ Tense, mood, and aspect
  - 📖 Literary techniques or devices
  - 🇯🇵 Japanese glosses (when helpful)

- Outputs `.txt` files with **Obsidian-style** footnotes like:

```text
She kept her composure[^1] even as the storm raged outside.

[^1]: 🧠 keep one's composure: remain calm and in control  🇯🇵 平静を保つ
```
